# 🌿 HabitNEST – Frontend Only

**HabitNEST** is a beautifully designed and fully responsive frontend web interface for a habit tracking application. This repository contains only the **frontend** part of the app — built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap — perfect for showcasing UI/UX or hosting on static platforms like **Vercel** or **GitHub Pages**.

---

## 🧾 Description

This is a **static HTML/CSS project** that simulates a full habit-tracking experience through mock UI pages. It's great for portfolios or frontend development practice. There is **no backend logic or user data handling** — just clean, interactive page designs.
